# su24-jpa-demo
## CRUD MVC App using JPA/Hibernate, MySQL, and ThymeLeaf.
## Instructions:
# Task Manager Application

This is an individual assignment. You are required to design and develop a web application that stores data persistently in a database.

## My Instructions for running the program (This took roughly 8 hours in total to complete. Starting the Friday of Memorial day Weekend and Continuing up until the day before it was due)

### Step 1: Fork and Clone the Repository

1. **Fork the Repository:**
  - Go to the provided demo repository: [su24-jpa-demo](https://github.com/uncg-csc340/su24-jpa-demo).
  - Click on the "Fork" button in the top-right corner to create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
  - Open your terminal or command prompt.
  - Clone your forked repository using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/su24-jpa-demo.git
    ```
  - Navigate into the cloned repository:
    ```bash
    cd su24-jpa-demo
    ```

### Step 2: View Dependencies and Set Up MySQL

1. **Dependencies:**
  - Open the `pom.xml` file in your project directory to check the project's dependencies. Ensure it includes Spring Boot, JPA, MySQL, and Thymeleaf.

2. **Set Up MySQL:**
  - **Install XAMPP:** If you haven't installed XAMPP, download and install it from [XAMPP official site](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
  - **Start XAMPP:**
    - Open the XAMPP Control Panel.
    - Start the Apache and MySQL services.
  - **Create Database:**
    - Open the MySQL command line or phpMyAdmin.
    - Create a database named `task_manager_db`:
      ```sql
      CREATE DATABASE task_manager_db;
      ```

3. **Configure Application Properties:**
  - Open the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file and configure the database connection:
    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/task_manager_db
    spring.datasource.username=root
    spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
    spring.jpa.show-sql=true
    ```

### Step 3: Run the Program

1. **Run the Spring Boot Application:**
  - In your terminal, navigate to the root directory of your project.
  - Use Maven to run the Spring Boot application:
    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```

### Step 4: Access the Application on Localhost

1. **Access the Application:**
  - Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`.
  - You should see the home page of your Task Manager application.

### Final Step: Commit and Push Changes

1. **Commit Your Changes:**
  - After implementing new features or making changes, you need to commit these changes.
  - Stage the changes:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
  - Commit the changes with a meaningful message:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Implemented task and goal management features"
    ```

2. **Push Changes to GitHub:**
  - Push your committed changes to your GitHub repository:
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

### Submission

1. **Update README.md:**
  - Include detailed instructions on how to run your application, including setting up the database and accessing the application on localhost. An example:
    ```markdown
    ## Task Manager Application

    ### How to Run

    1. **Clone the Repository:**
       ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/your-username/su24-jpa-demo.git
       cd su24-jpa-demo
       ```

    2. **Set Up MySQL:**
      - Install XAMPP and start MySQL.
      - Create a database named `task_manager_db`.

    3. **Configure the Application:**
      - Update `src/main/resources/application.properties` with your MySQL credentials.

    4. **Run the Application:**
       ```bash
       ./mvnw spring-boot:run
       ```

    5. **Access the Application:**
      - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`.

    ### Database Schema

    - Include a `.sql` file for the database schema, if necessary.
    

2. **Submit the GitHub Repository Link:**
  - Copy the URL of your GitHub repository and submit it as required.

## Things to Note

- **Dependencies:** Ensure all necessary dependencies are included in your `pom.xml` file.
- **Database Setup:** Make sure to set up your MySQL database correctly and update your `application.properties` file with the correct credentials.
- **Running the Application:** Always check if your MySQL server is running before starting the Spring Boot application.

By following these steps, you will have a fully functional Task Manager application that you can run locally and submit for your assignment.

- Final Step: Commit, and then push any changes. 
## Things to note:
- [Dependencies](https://github.com/uncg-csc340/su24-jpa-demo/blob/11cd883de7e1acbbc1de2430d368f8934085efac/pom.xml#L19) to JPA and MySQL, in addition to the usual. JPA handles the persistence, MySQL is the database to be used.
- [`/src/main/resources/application.properties`](https://github.com/uncg-csc340/su24-jpa-demo/blob/11cd883de7e1acbbc1de2430d368f8934085efac/src/main/resources/application.properties) file  is the configuration for the MySQL database.
  - the database name is between the last `/` and the `?`. In this case the database name is `340-test`.
  - You MUST have the database up and running before running the project! 
    - Open your XAMPP Control Panel.
    - Start the Apache server.
    - Start MySQL.
    - Click on MySQL "Admin" to open up the DBMS.
    - Ensure the database that you need is available.
- [Entity](https://github.com/uncg-csc340/su24-jpa-demo/blob/11cd883de7e1acbbc1de2430d368f8934085efac/src/main/java/com/csc340/jpademo/student/Student.java#L7)
  - The Student class is annotated as an `@Entity `. This is used by Hibernate (an implementation of the Jakarta Persistence API) to map class attributes to database tables and SQL types.
  - We also annotated with `@Table` to give Hibernate directions to use this specific table name. This is optional but it helps with naming conventions.
  - Any Entity must have at least one attribute that is annotated as an `@Id`. In our case it's conveniently the `id` attribute.
    - We are also using an autogeneration strategy for the ID. This way we are not manually assigning IDs to our students. This is optional.
  - An Entity must have a no-argument constructor.
- [Repository](https://github.com/uncg-csc340/su24-jpa-demo/blob/11cd883de7e1acbbc1de2430d368f8934085efac/src/main/java/com/csc340/jpademo/student/StudentRepository.java)
  - We are using an extension of the JPA Repository that comes with prebuilt database operations such as select all, select by id, select by any other reference, insert, delete, etc.
  - Annotate it as a `@Repository`.
  - We parametrize this using our object and its ID type.
    - `public interface StudentRepository extends JpaRepository<Student, Integer>` => We want to apply the JPA repository operations on the `Student` type. The `Student` has an ID of type `int`.
  - If we need special database queries that are not the standard ones mentioned above, we can create a method with a special purpose query as shown. This is an interface so no implementation body.
- [Controller](https://github.com/uncg-csc340/su24-jpa-demo/blob/11cd883de7e1acbbc1de2430d368f8934085efac/src/main/java/com/csc340/jpademo/student/StudentController.java)
  - All the usual except we added a global request mapping, to avoid repeating the mapping prefix all over the place.
  - All the mappings under this controller will start with `/students`.
  - Return view names.
  - Return `"redirect:/link/to/redirect"` - if there is not necessarily a view attached to an action. e.g. going back to list after deleting one item.
  - Model attribute names and objects using `model.addAttribute("studentList", service.getAllStudents());`
  - All views live in `src/main/resources/templates`.
    - You can also create subfolders in the templates forlder. For example if you wanted views for the student to be in one folder you can create a `students` subfolder and put all the student views in there. Then your Controller would have to `return "students/students-list";` 
  - The Service class is [`@Autowired`](https://github.com/uncg-csc340/su24-jpa-demo/blob/11cd883de7e1acbbc1de2430d368f8934085efac/src/main/java/com/csc340/jpademo/student/StudentController.java#L15). Do not use a constructor, this will not work.
    - In the Service class,the Repository class is also [`@Autowired`](https://github.com/uncg-csc340/su24-jpa-demo/blob/11cd883de7e1acbbc1de2430d368f8934085efac/src/main/java/com/csc340/jpademo/student/StudentService.java#L10)  :)
- Views
  - [`data-th-each="student : ${studentList}"`](https://github.com/uncg-csc340/su24-jpa-demo/blob/2b1e993775bc25f77e141689b8679d39c0bd840f/src/main/resources/templates/student-list.html#L45) => "For each student in studentList, make a table row"
  - `<p data-th-text="${student.id}"></p>` => "The text content for this this paragraph element should be whatever the student id is".
  - [`<a data-th-href="@{/students/{id} (id=${student.id})}" data-th-text="${student.id}"></a>`](https://github.com/uncg-csc340/su24-jpa-demo/blob/2b1e993775bc25f77e141689b8679d39c0bd840f/src/main/resources/templates/student-list.html#L47) => Make a link that includes a variable in the path. Here the variabe `id` is the student id. The text shown by the link is also the student id (otherwise it will be bank and you cannot click on anything).We are using the @ notation because we need access to the objects. Other links that do not include data from the model can be made the regular HTML way.
  - For any form that sends POST requests with the form body, the input attribute "name" should match the data field. E.g for the student major [`<input type="text" id="major" name="major" placeholder="Major"/>`](https://github.com/uncg-csc340/su24-jpa-demo/blob/11cd883de7e1acbbc1de2430d368f8934085efac/src/main/resources/templates/student-list.html#L33) we use `name="major"` to use the setters to match that field. If you do not include the input name attribute, a null will be insterted for that field.
  - Remember that any view must have a correspoding mapping.
    - If you wanted to have a page that is a standalone form, you must make a mapping in the controller that returns the form page as a view.
    - In this example, the form for creating a new student comes with the list view so this is not necessary.
    - However, the form for updating a Student is different. We add a [`@GetMapping`](https://github.com/uncg-csc340/su24-jpa-demo/blob/11cd883de7e1acbbc1de2430d368f8934085efac/src/main/java/com/csc340/jpademo/student/StudentController.java#L42) for displaying the form.
    - Clicking on Edit for any student will hit this endpoint and return the form as a view.
    - Note we also use the model here to carry the Student data that we want to update so it will be shown on the form.
    - Saving the updated data calls the corresponding POST mapping.
      - NB: Saving and Updating in Hibernate uses the same method. If an entity exists it gets updated, else it gets created. You don't need to worry too much about it.
       ```
         @Transactional
         public <S extends T> S save(S entity) {
           if (this.entityInformation.isNew(entity)) {
              this.em.persist(entity);
              return entity;
            } else {
              return this.em.merge(entity);
          }
         }
        ```
- Run the app in IntelliJ, then on the browser go to: `http://localhost:8080/students/all`
